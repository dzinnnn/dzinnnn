ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dzinnnn
ðŸ’» Learning SQL: Currently honing my skills in Microsoft SQL Server, exploring everything from basic queries to advanced data management.
ðŸŽ¯ Career Goals: Aspiring Data Analyst or Database Developerâ€”still exploring which path to choose, but excited about both.
ðŸŽ¸ Personal Interests: Big fan of Dean Martin, and when Iâ€™m not coding, you can probably find me out by the water, spinning for pike. Fishing and music are my best ways to unwind.
ðŸŒ± Currently Exploring:
SQL syntax, queries, and data management basics.
Practical projects and real-world applications of SQL (always open to project ideas!).
